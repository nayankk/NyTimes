*NyTimes* is an android app that fetches the articles from New York Times API's and displays them in a Grid View. User can also filter the search results using custom filters. 

Completed user stories:

 * User can enter a search query that will display a grid of news articles using the thumbnail and headline from the New York Times Search API
 * User can click on "settings" which allows selection of advanced search options to filter results. 
 * User can configure advanced search filters such as : Begin Date, News Desk values, Sort order
 * Subsequent searches will have any filters applied to the search results.
 * User can tap on any article in results to view the contents in an embedded browser.
 * User can scroll down "infinitely" to continue loading more news articles. The maximum number of articles is limited by the API search.
 * Replace Filter Settings Activity with a lightweight DialogFragment.
 * Improve the user interface and experiment with image assets and/or styling and coloring
 * Apply the popular ButterKnife annotation library to reduce view boilerplate.

Note: Planning to implement the rest of the "Advanced" and "Bonus" user stories this week.
